Hi everyone !

This is a simple Mastermind Angular Project that i have done recently.
You can pull it if you want and look at the code or even run it on your computer.

The more important into this code will be the "wdg-game" component.
It contain all the logic of the game.
It also contain some unit tests with Karma (just testing two functions if they're working/responding)

You can also see the differents components to see how they communicate between them.

I've added some 'light' comments to help you to understand the code.

Don't forget to run 'npm install' into the folder project if you can't run it at the first time with ng serve.

For the test you can run 'ng test' or even 'npm test'.

If you want more informations, just check the informations below.

And if you still having some troubles, just go here : https://mastermind-4537a.web.app/

This is this application deployed on firebase. The responsive (with mobile phone) will not work at 100%, it's 'normal', i still not worked on it. But it work pretty well on computers.

Anyway, Thank you, and have a nice day !
